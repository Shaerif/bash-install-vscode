## Restricted Mode 🔒

It might be that upon opening Visual Studio Code, some of the installed extensions are disabled. This is because you are using VS code in **restricted mode**. 

From the Visual Studio Code documentation on Workspace Trust:

> Restricted Mode tries to prevent automatic code execution by disabling or limiting the operation of several VS Code features: tasks, debugging, workspace settings, and extensions.

To view the list of disabled extensions, go to *Extensions* on the left-hand side menu (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), the search `@workspaceUnsupported`. 

You can circumvent this problem by selecting `Trust` in the central panel:

- [Workaround & Manage Settings](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67940194)

## Troubleshooting 🔧
If you encounter issues:
1. Verify internet connectivity
2. Check sudo privileges
3. For Snap errors:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snapd
sudo snap install core
```
4. For extension installation failures:
```bash
code --list-extensions
code --install-extension <extension-id> --force
```

```bash
